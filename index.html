    <p>This document defines a mechanism that enables developers to declare a reporting policy for a web application. A user agent can use this policy to report encountered network errors that prevented it from successfully fetching requested resources. Additionally, developers can control the format of the error reports and their transmission mechanism.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Accurately measuring performance characteristics of web applications is an important aspect in helping site developers understand how to improve their web applications. The worst case scenario is the failure to load the application, or a particular resource, due to a network error, and to address such failures the developer requires assistance from the user agent to identify when, where, and why such failures are occurring.</p>

    <p>Today, application developers do not have real-time web application availability data from their end users. For example, if the user fails to load the page due to a network error, such as a failed DNS lookup, a connection timeout, a reset connection, or other reasons, the site developer is unable to detect and address this issue. Existing methods, such as synthetic monitoring provide a partial solution by placing monitoring nodes in predetermined geographic locations, but require additional infrastructure investments, and cannot provide truly global and near real-time availability data for real end users.</p>

    <p>Network Error Logging (<dfn>NEL</dfn>) addresses this need by defining a mechanism enabling web applications to declare a reporting policy that can be used by the user agent to report network errors for a given origin. To take advantage of <a>NEL</a>, a web application opts into using <a>NEL</a> by supplying a <code>NEL</code> HTTP response header field that describes the reporting policy. Then, if the <a>NEL</a> policy is available for a given origin, and an end user fails to successfully fetch a resource from that origin, the user agent logs the network error report and attempts to deliver it to the report URL defined by the policy - the delivery is done on a best effort basis and might be delayed due to connectivity issues or other reasons.</p>

      <h2>Key Concepts and Terminology</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>origin</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Defined by the Origin specification. [[RFC6454]]</dd>
        <dt><dfn>JSON object</dfn></dt>
        <dt><dfn>JSON stringification</dfn></dt>

      </dl>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Policy Delivery and Processing</h2>
      <p>The server delivers the <a>NEL policy</a> to the user agent via an HTTP response header field (<a>NEL header field</a>). The policy MUST be delivered over a secure transport. If the policy is delivered over a secure transport with no underlying secure transport errors or warnings, and its format conforms to the specified grammar, the user agent MUST either:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Register the host as a <a>known NEL host</a> if it is not already registered.</li>
        <li>Update the registered policy for the <a>known NEL host</a> if the provided policy is different than that already stored by the user agent.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Otherwise, if the policy is received over an insecure transport, or if the policy does not conform to the specified grammar, then the user agent MUST ignore it.</p>

      <p class="note">The application does not need to be HTTPS-only to take advantage of NEL. To enable NEL reporting for an HTTP site the application can fetch a single "NEL registration resource" (e.g fetch an empty pixel) from the same domain name but over a secure transport - e.g. `http://example.com` can fetch `https://example.com/registerNEL`. Once registered, the NEL policy applies to both HTTPS and HTTP fetches for that <a>NEL host</a> - i.e. an NEL registration for `https://example.com` also applies to `http://example.com` fetches.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>`NEL` Header Field</h2>
        <p>The <dfn>NEL header field</dfn> is used to communicate the <dfn>NEL policy</dfn> to the user agent. The ABNF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form) syntax for the <a>NEL header field</a> is as follows:</p>

        <pre>
NEL = "NEL" ":" [ directive ]  \\\*( ";" [ directive ] )

directive                 = directive-name [ "=" directive-value ]
directive-name            = token
directive-value           = token | quoted-string
        </pre>

        <p>See [[!RFC7230]] section 3.2.6 for definitions of `token` and `quoted-string`. This specification defines three NEL directives: <a>report-uri</a>, <a>max-age</a>, and <a>includeSubDomains</a>. The overall requirements for directives are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The order of appearance of directives is not significant.</li>
          <li>All directives MUST appear only once in an <a>NEL header field</a>. Directives are either optional or required, as stipulated in their definitions.</li>
          <li>Directive names are case-insensitive.</li>
          <li>User agents MUST ignore any <a>NEL header field</a> containing directives, or other header field value data, that does not conform to the syntax defined in this specification.</li>
          <li>If an <a>NEL header field</a> contains directive(s) not recognized by the user agent, the user agent MUST ignore the unrecognized directives, and if the <a>NEL header field</a> otherwise satisfies the above requirements, the user agent MUST process the recognized directives.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Additional directives extending the semantic functionality of the <a>NEL header field</a> can be defined in other specifications, with a registry (having an IANA policy definition of IETF Review [[!RFC5226]]) defined for them at such time.</p>

        <p>The user agent MUST ignore the NEL header specified via a <code>meta</code> element to mitigate hijacking of error reporting via scripting attacks. The <a>NEL policy</a> MUST be delivered via the <a>NEL header field</a>.</p>

        <p class="note">The restriction on <code>meta</code> element is consistent with [[CSP]] specification, which restricts reporting registration to HTTP header fields only for same reasons.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>The `report-uri` Directive</h2>
          <p>The <dfn>report-uri</dfn> directive specifies a URL to which the user agent sends reports about network errors. The <a>report-uri</a> directive is a REQUIRED field to register an <a>NEL policy</a>, and OPTIONAL if the intent is to remove a previous registration - see <a>max-age</a>. The ABNF grammar for the name and value of the directive is:</p>

          <pre>
directive-name    = "report-uri"
directive-value   = 1\\\*uri-reference
          </pre>

          <p>The <dfn>set of report URLs</dfn> is the value of the <a>report-uri</a> directive, which contains one or more `uri-reference`'s, each resolved relative to the URL of the fetched resource that specified the policy - see [[!RFC3986]] section 4 and appendix C for definition of `uri-reference` and delimiting recommendations.</p>

          <p>Each <a title="report-uri">report URL</a> in the provided <a>set of report URLs</a>  MUST use a secure transport to receive the NEL reports. If any of the provided <a title="report-uri">report URL's</a> does not use a secure transport, the user agent MUST ignore the provided policy. The process of sending network error reports to the specified URL's in this directive's value is defined in this documents <a href="#reporting"></a> section.</p>

          <p class="note">To improve delivery of NEL reports the application should set `report-uri` to an alternative origin whose infrastructure is not coupled with the origin from which the resource is being fetched &mdash; otherwise network errors cannot be reported until the problem is solved, if ever &mdash; and provide multiple `report-uri`'s to provide fallback alternatives if the preceding `report-uri` is unreachable.</p>

        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>The `max-age` Directive</h2>
          <p>The REQUIRED <dfn>max-age</dfn> directive specifies the number of seconds, after the reception of the NEL header field, during which the user agent regards the host (from whom the policy was received) as a <a>known NEL host</a>. The ABNF grammar for the name and value of the directive is:</p>

          <pre>
directive-name    = "max-age"
directive-value   = delta-seconds
          </pre>

          <p>See [[!RFC7234]] section 1.2.1 for definition of `delta-seconds`. A <a>max-age</a> value of zero (i.e. "max-age=0") signals the user agent to cease regarding the host as a <a>known NEL host</a>, including the <a>includeSubDomains</a> directive if provided.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>The `includeSubDomains` Directive</h2>
          <p>The OPTIONAL <dfn>includeSubDomains</dfn> directive is a valueless directive that, if present, signals the user agent that the <a>NEL policy</a> applies to this <a>NEL host</a> as well as any subdomains of the host's domain name.</p>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Policy Storage and Maintenance</h2>

      <p>An HTTP host declares itself an <dfn>NEL host</dfn> by issuing an <a>NEL policy</a>, which is communicated via the <a>NEL header field</a> over secure transport (e.g., TLS). Upon error-free receipt and processing of this header by a conformant user agent, the user agent regards the host as a <dfn>known NEL host</dfn>.</p>

      <p>The user agent MUST store and index NEL policies based strictly upon the domain names of the issuing <a title="NEL host">NEL hosts</a>. An <a>NEL policy</a> may contain an optional <a>includeSubDomains</a> directive specifying that this policy also applies to any hosts whose domain names are subdomains of the <a title="known NEL host">known NEL host's</a> domain name.</p>

      <p>The user agent MUST maintain the <a>NEL policy</a> of any given <a>NEL host</a> separately from any NEL policies issued by any other <a title="NEL host">NEL hosts</a> whose domain names are superdomains or subdomains of the given <a title="NEL host">NEL host's</a> domain name. Only the given <a>NEL host</a> can update or cause deletion of its <a>NEL policy</a>. This is accomplished by sending a <a>NEL header field</a> to the user agent with new values for the policy <a title="report-uri">report URL</a>, <a title="max-age">time duration</a>, and <a title="includeSubDomains">subdomain applicability</a>. Thus, the user agent MUST store the "freshest" <a>NEL policy</a> information on behalf of an <a>NEL host</a>, and specifying a zero time duration MUST cause the user agent to delete the <a>NEL policy</a> (including any asserted <a>includeSubDomains</a> directive) for that <a>NEL host</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Reporting</h2>

      <p>A <dfn>network error</dfn> is any condition where a connection or a  protocol error is encountered by the user agent, thus preventing it from successfully completing the request-response exchange. This may include, but is not limited to DNS, TCP, TLS, and HTTP connection and protocol errors. For example, a <a>network error</a> is triggered when the user agent:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Fails to resolve the DNS name</li>
        <li>Fails to establish a TCP connection</li>
        <li>Fails to establish a secure TLS tunnel</li>
        <li>Fails to fetch the resource due to a TLS protocol error</li>
        <li>Fails to fetch the resource due to a HTTP protocol error</li>
        <li>Fails to fetch the resource due to a socket timeout or error</li>
        <li>Fails to fetch the resource due to a redirect loop</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The user agent MAY classify and report server error responses (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.6">5xx status code</a>, [[RFC7231]]) as network errors. For example, a network error report may be triggered when a fetch fails due to proxy or gateway errors, service downtime, and other types of server errors.</p>

      <p>The failure to fetch a resource when the user agent is known to be offline (when <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#navigator.online">`navigator.onLine`</a> returns `false`) MUST NOT be considered to be a <a>network error</a>.</p>

      <p class="note">Note that the above definition of "network error" is different from definition in [[Fetch]]. The definition of <a>network error</a> in this specification is a subset of [[Fetch]] definition - i.e. all of the above conditions would trigger a "network error" in [[Fetch]] processing, but conditions such as blocked requests due to mixed content, CORS failures, etc., would not.</p>

      <p>When a <a>network error</a> occurs for a URL that belongs to a <a>known NEL host</a> the user agent MUST log the error and attempt to deliver it to the <a title="report-uri">report URL</a> defined by the <a>NEL policy</a> of the associated <a>NEL host</a>:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The user agent SHOULD make best effort to deliver the error report as soon as possible to provide the necessary real-time feedback.</li>
        <li>The user agent MAY delay delivery of the report to account for poor or missing connectivity (e.g. temporarily offline due to poor service).</li>
        <li>The user agent MAY abandon delivery of the report if the time of error exceeds 24 hours, or if the <a title="report-uri">report URL</a> is not responding or returns an error.</li>
        <li>The user agent MAY aggregate multiple error reports for the same <a>NEL host</a> and deliver them in a single report.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To generate a <dfn>network error object</dfn>, the user agent MUST use an algorithm equivalent to the following:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Prepare a JSON object <i>neterror</i> with the following keys and values:

          <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/CR/webappapis.html#queue-a-task">Queue a task</a> to <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/CR/infrastructure.html#fetch">fetch</a> <a title="report-uri">report URL</a> using HTTP method POST, with a `Content-Type` header field of `application/nel-report`, and an entity body consisting of <a>report body</a>. If the origin of <a title="report-uri">report URL</a> is not the same as the origin of the <a>NEL host</a> for which the report is generated, the block cookies flag MUST also be set. The user agent MUST NOT follow redirects when fetching this resource and ignore the fetched response if one is provided. The task source for these tasks is the "Network Error Logging" task source.</li>

          <li>If the fetch is successful (2xx HTTP response code), the user agent MUST abort the remaining steps.</li>

          <li>If the fetch failed after multiple delivery attempts the user agent MAY update the <a>NEL policy</a> by removing the current <a title="report-uri">report URL</a> from the <a>set of report URLs</a>.

          <p class="note">The user agent is allowed to garbage collect report-uri's that are no longer functional, but it should account for common failure cases such as captive portals, which may temporarily prevent it from delivering the error reports.

          <li>If the user agent has reached the end of the set of <a title="report-uri">report URLs</a>, the user agent MUST sleep before returning to the beginning of the set and reattempting delivery - e.g. use exponential backoff. Otherwise, the user agent MUST attempt immediate delivery of the error report to the next <a title="report-uri">report URL</a> in the <a>set of report URLs</a>.</li>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <section>
        <h2>Sample Policy Definitions</h2>
        <pre class="example">
&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: example.com

&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt; ...
&lt; NEL: report-uri="/report"; max-age=2592000
        </pre>

        <p>The above <a>NEL policy</a> provided in the server response specifies that the user agent should register a new <a>NEL policy</a>, or update an existing one if one already exists, for the `example.com` <a>NEL host</a>: the user agent should report network errors to `/report` URL resolved relative to the origin of the <a>NEL host</a>, and that the policy applies for 2592000 seconds (30 days).</p>

        <p>Note that above registration will only succeed if the response is delivered over a secure transport - see <a href="#policy-delivery-and-processing"></a>. To register an NEL policy:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>An HTTPS application can respond with the <a>NEL policy</a> in its response.</li>
          <li>An HTTP application can provide a single "NEL registration resource" on the same domain but over a secure transport.</li>
        </ul>

        <pre class="example">
&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: example.com

&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt; ...
&lt; NEL: report-uri="https://other-origin.com/report"; max-age=2592000
        </pre>

        <p>The above <a>NEL policy</a> provided in the server response is similar to the previous example but tells the user agent to report network errors to `https://other-origin.com/report`. The use of an alternative origin that is not coupled with the origin that is being accessed is **strongly encouraged** to enable real-time reporting and improved report delivery - see <a href="#the-report-uri-directive"></a>.</p>

        <pre class="example">
&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: example.com

&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt; ...
&lt; NEL: report-uri="/report" "https://other-origin.com/report"; max-age=2592000; includeSubDomains
        </pre>

        <p>The above <a>NEL policy</a> provided in the server response specifies that the user agent should report network errors to `/report` URL resolved relative to the origin of the <a>NEL host</a>, or `https://other-origin.com/report` if `/errors` is unreachable. Further, the policy is extended to all of the subdomains of the issuing <a>NEL host</a> - see <a href="#the-includesubdomains-directive"></a>.</p>

        <pre class="example">
&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: example.com

&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt; ...
&lt; NEL: max-age=0
        </pre>

        <p>The above <a>NEL policy</a> provided in the server response contains <a>max-age</a> set to zero, which indicates that the user agent must delete the current registered <a>NEL policy</a> associated with the `example.com` <a>NEL Host</a> and all of its subdomains:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a>includeSubDomains</a> is implicit when <a>max-age</a> is zero</li>
          <li><a>report-uri</a> is optional when removing a previously registered policy</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sample Network Error Reports</h2>
        <p>This section contains an example network error report the user agent might send when a network error is encountered for a <a>known NEL host</a>.</p>

        <pre class="highlight">
{
        "nel-report": [
            {
              "uri": "https://www.example.com/",
              "referrer": "http://example.com/",
              "server-ip": "123.122.121.120",
              "protocol": "h2-15",
              "status-code": 200,
              "elapsed-time": 823,
              "age": 0,
              "type": "http.protocol.error"
            }
          ]
        }
        </pre>

        <p>The above report indicates that the user agent attempted to navigate from "example.com" to "www.example.com" (<a>known NEL host</a>), which successfully resolved to the "123.122.121.120" IP address. However, while the user agent received a "200" response from the server via the "h2-15" protocol, it encountered a protocol error in the exchange and was forced to abandon the navigation. 823 milliseconds elapsed between the start of navigation and when the user agent aborted the navigation. Finally, the user agent sent this report immediately after the network error was encountered - i.e. the report age is 0.</p>

        <pre class="highlight">
{
        "nel-report": [
            {
              "uri": "https://widget.com/thing.js",
              "referrer": "https://www.example.com/",
              "server-ip": "234.233.232.231",
              "protocol": "",
              "status-code": 0,

            }
          ]
        }
        </pre>

        <p>The above report indicates that the user agent attempted to fetch  "https://widget.com/thing.js", which belongs to a previously registered <a>NEL host</a>, from "www.example.com" origin. However, the user agent was unable to resolve the DNS name and the request was aborted by the user agent after 143 milliseconds. Because "widget.com" is a known NEL host, a network error report was logged and sent to the report URL specified by the NEL policy of that host immediately after the network error was encountered - i.e. the report age is 0.</p>

      <h2>Use cases</h2>

      <section>
        <h2>Reporting of Navigation Failures</h2>

        <p>A navigation request initiated by the user (e.g. via a click on a link, direct input via the location bar, script-initiated due to user interaction, etc.) may fail due any number of connectivity reasons: DNS failure, TCP error, TLS protocol violation, and so on. These errors may be caused by network misconfiguration, transient routing issues, server downtime, malware or other attacks against the user, etc.</p>

        <p>In such cases the destination host is often left unaware of the failed navigation since, by definition, it cannot see the request reach its infrastructure and it is unable to investigate the problem. To address this, the host can register an <a>NEL policy</a> with the user agent, which specifies where reports of such failures should be delivered such that they can be investigated.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Reporting of First-party Subresource Fetch Failures</h2>

        <p>A typical application requires dozens of resources, the fetching of which is typically initiated via HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. The application requesting such resources can observe failures of most such fetches (e.g. via `onerror` callbacks), but it does not have access to the detailed network error report of why the failure has occurred - e.g. DNS failure, TCP error, TLS protocol violation, etc.</p>

        <p>To address this, the application can register relevant NEL policies with the user agent for the first-party hosts from which the subresources are being fetched. Then, if such a policy is present and a network error is encountered for a resource associated with a registered <a>NEL host</a>, the user agent will report the detailed network error report and enable the application developers to investigate the error.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Reporting of Third-party Subresource Fetch Failures</h2>

        <p>In the case where a resource is embedded by a third party, the provider of the resource is often unable to instrument and observe the failure. For example, if `example.com` embeds a `widget.com/thing.js` resource on its site, and the user visiting `example.com` fails to fetch such resource due to a network error, the `widget.com` host is both unaware of the failure and unable to detect it.</p>

        <p>To address this, `widget.com` can register an NEL policy for its host. Then, if such policy is present and a network error is encountered while fetching a resource &mdash; regardless of whether it is being requested from a first-party or third-party origin &mdash; from the registered <a>NEL host</a>, the user agent will report the network error and enable the provider to investigate the error.</p>
