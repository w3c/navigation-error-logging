    <p>This document defines a mechanism that enables developers to declare a network error reporting policy for a web application. A user agent can use this policy to report encountered network errors that prevented it from successfully fetching requested resources.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Accurately measuring performance characteristics of web applications is an important aspect in helping site developers understand how to improve their web applications. The worst case scenario is the failure to load the application, or a particular resource, due to a network error, and to address such failures the developer requires assistance from the user agent to identify when, where, and why such failures are occurring.</p>

    <p>Today, application developers do not have real-time web application availability data from their end users. For example, if the user fails to load the page due to a network error, such as a failed DNS lookup, a connection timeout, a reset connection, or other reasons, the site developer is unable to detect and address this issue. Existing methods, such as synthetic monitoring provide a partial solution by placing monitoring nodes in predetermined geographic locations, but require additional infrastructure investments, and cannot provide truly global and near real-time availability data for real end users.</p>

    <p>Network Error Logging (<dfn>NEL</dfn>) addresses this need by defining a mechanism enabling web applications to declare a reporting policy that can be used by the user agent to report network errors for a given origin. To take advantage of <a>NEL</a>, a web application opts into using <a>NEL</a> by supplying a <code>NEL</code> HTTP response header field that describes the reporting policy. Then, if the <a>NEL</a> policy is available for a given origin, and an end user fails to successfully fetch a resource from that origin, the user agent logs the network error report and attempts to deliver it to the report URL defined by the policy - the delivery is done on a best effort basis and might be delayed due to connectivity issues or other reasons.</p>

    <p>For example, if the user agent fails to fetch a resource from <code>https://www.example.com</code> due to an aborted TCP connection, the user agent would notify the report URL defined by the NEL policy associated with that origin, by delivering the following report:</p>

    <pre class="highlight">
{
      "nel-report": [
          {
            "uri": "https://www.example.com/resource",
            "referrer": "https://referrer.com/",
            "server-ip": "123.122.121.120",
            "elapsed-time": 321,
            "age": 0,
            "type": "tcp.aborted"
          }
        ]
    }
    </pre>

    <p>See <a href="#reporting">reporting</a> for explanation of the communicated fields and format of the report, and <a href="#examples">examples</a> for more hands-on examples of NEL registration and reporting process.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Policy Delivery and Processing</h2>
      <p>The server delivers the <a>NEL policy</a> to the user agent via an HTTP response header field (<a>NEL header field</a>). If the result of executing <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/powerfulfeatures/#is-origin-trustworthy">is-origin-trusworthy</a> algorithm ([[!POWERFUL-FEATURES]]) on <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-3.2">origin</a> that served the <a>NEL policy</a> is `Potentially Trustworthy` then the user agent MUST either:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Register the host as a <a>known NEL origin</a> if it is not already registered.</li>
        <li>Update the registered policy for the <a>known NEL origin</a> if the provided policy is different than that already stored by the user agent.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Otherwise, if the result of the algorithm is **not** `Potentionally Trustworthy`, then the user MUST ignore the provided <a>NEL policy</a>.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>`NEL` Header Field</h2>
        <p>The <dfn>NEL header field</dfn> is used to communicate the <dfn>NEL policy</dfn> to the user agent. The ABNF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form) syntax for the <a>NEL header field</a> is as follows:</p>

        <pre>
NEL = "NEL" ":" [ directive ]  \\\*( ";" [ directive ] )

directive                 = directive-name [ "=" directive-value ]
directive-name            = token
directive-value           = token | quoted-string
        </pre>

        <p>See [[!RFC7230]] section 3.2.6 for definitions of `token` and `quoted-string`. This specification defines three NEL directives: <a>report-uri</a>, <a>max-age</a>, and <a>includeSubDomains</a>. The overall requirements for directives are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Directive may be optional or required.</li>
          <li>Directive names are case-insensitive.</li>
          <li>Directive order is not significant.</li>
          <li>Directive should be specified once.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>User agents MUST ignore any unknown or invalid directive(s), or other header field value data, that does not conform to the syntax defined in this specification. A valid <a>NEL header field</a> MUST, at a minimum, contain all of the "REQUIRED" directives defined in this specification.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>If a directive is specified multiple times within the same <a>NEL header field</a>, the user agent MUST process the first declaration and ignore the rest.</li>
          <li>If multiple valid <a>NEL header field</a>'s are present, the user agent MUST process the first valid header field and ignore the rest.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The user agent MUST ignore the NEL header specified via a <code>meta</code> element to mitigate hijacking of error reporting via scripting attacks. The <a>NEL policy</a> MUST be delivered via the <a>NEL header field</a>.</p>

        <p class="note">The restriction on <code>meta</code> element is consistent with [[CSP]] specification, which restricts reporting registration to HTTP header fields only for same reasons.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>The `report-uri` Directive</h2>
          <p>The <dfn>report-uri</dfn> directive specifies a URL to which the user agent sends reports about network errors. The <a>report-uri</a> directive is a REQUIRED field to register an <a>NEL policy</a>, and OPTIONAL if the intent is to remove a previous registration - see <a>max-age</a>. The ABNF grammar for the name and value of the directive is:</p>

          <pre>
directive-name    = "report-uri"
directive-value   = 1\\\*absolute-URI
          </pre>

          <p>The <dfn>set of report URLs</dfn> is the value of the <a>report-uri</a> directive, which contains one or more `absolute-URI`'s - see [[!RFC3986]] section 4.3. Each `absolute-URI` value SHOULD be delimited within double-quotes.</p>

          <p>The result of executing the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/powerfulfeatures/#is-origin-trustworthy">is-origin-trustworthy</a> algorithm on origin of each <a title="report-uri">report URL</a> in the provided <a>set of report URLs</a> MUST return `Potentially Trustworthy`. <a title="report-uri">Report URL's</a> that fail this criteria MUST be ignored by the user agent. The process of sending network error reports to the specified URL's in this directive's value is defined in this documents <a href="#reporting"></a> section.</p>

          <p class="note">To improve delivery of NEL reports the application should set `report-uri` to an alternative origin whose infrastructure is not coupled with the origin from which the resource is being fetched &mdash; otherwise network errors cannot be reported until the problem is solved, if ever &mdash; and provide multiple `report-uri`'s to provide fallback alternatives if the preceding `report-uri` is unreachable.</p>

        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>The `max-age` Directive</h2>
          <p>The REQUIRED <dfn>max-age</dfn> directive specifies the number of seconds, after the reception of the NEL header field, during which the user agent regards the host (from whom the policy was received) as a <a>known NEL origin</a>. The ABNF grammar for the name and value of the directive is:</p>

          <pre>
directive-name    = "max-age"
directive-value   = delta-seconds
          </pre>

          <p>See [[!RFC7234]] section 1.2.1 for definition of `delta-seconds`. A <a>max-age</a> value of zero (i.e. "max-age=0") signals the user agent to cease regarding the host as a <a>known NEL origin</a>, including the <a>includeSubDomains</a> directive if provided.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>The `includeSubDomains` Directive</h2>
          <p>The OPTIONAL <dfn>includeSubDomains</dfn> directive is a valueless directive that, if present, signals the user agent that the <a>NEL policy</a> applies not only to the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-3.2">origin</a> that served the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3">resource representation</a>, but also to any <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-3.2">origin</a> whose <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-host">host</a> component is a subdomain of the <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-host">host</a> component of the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3">resource representation</a>’s <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-3.2">origin</a>.</p>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Policy Storage and Maintenance</h2>

      <p>An HTTP host declares itself an <dfn>NEL origin</dfn> by issuing an <a>NEL policy</a>, which is communicated via the <a>NEL header field</a> from a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/powerfulfeatures/#is-origin-trustworthy">`Potentially Trustworthy` origin</a>. Upon error-free receipt and processing of this header by a conformant user agent, the user agent regards the host as a <dfn>known NEL origin</dfn>.</p>

      <p>The user agent MUST maintain the <a>NEL policy</a> of any given <a>NEL origin</a> separately from any NEL policies issued by any other <a title="NEL origin">NEL origins</a>. Only the given <a>NEL origin</a> can update or cause deletion of its <a>NEL policy</a>. This is accomplished by sending a <a>NEL header field</a> to the user agent with new values for the policy <a title="report-uri">report URL</a>, <a title="max-age">time duration</a>, and <a title="includeSubDomains">subdomain applicability</a>. Thus, the user agent MUST store the "freshest" <a>NEL policy</a> information on behalf of an <a>NEL origin</a>, and specifying a zero time duration MUST cause the user agent to delete the <a>NEL policy</a> (including any asserted <a>includeSubDomains</a> directive) for that <a>NEL origin</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Reporting</h2>

      <p>A <dfn>network error</dfn> is any condition where a connection or a  protocol error is encountered by the user agent, thus preventing it from successfully completing the request-response exchange. This may include, but is not limited to DNS, TCP, TLS, and HTTP connection and protocol errors. For example, a <a>network error</a> is triggered when the user agent:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Fails to resolve the DNS name</li>
        <li>Fails to establish a TCP connection</li>
        <li>Fails to establish a secure TLS tunnel</li>
        <li>Fails to fetch the resource due to a TLS protocol error</li>
        <li>Fails to fetch the resource due to a HTTP protocol error</li>
        <li>Fails to fetch the resource due to a socket timeout or error</li>
        <li>Fails to fetch the resource due to a redirect loop</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The user agent MAY classify and report server error responses (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.6">5xx status code</a>, [[RFC7231]]) as network errors. For example, a network error report may be triggered when a fetch fails due to proxy or gateway errors, service downtime, and other types of server errors.</p>

      <p>The failure to fetch a resource when the user agent is known to be offline (when <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#navigator.online">`navigator.onLine`</a> returns `false`) MUST NOT be considered to be a <a>network error</a>.</p>

      <p class="note">Note that the above definition of "network error" is different from definition in [[Fetch]]. The definition of <a>network error</a> in this specification is a subset of [[Fetch]] definition - i.e. all of the above conditions would trigger a "network error" in [[Fetch]] processing, but conditions such as blocked requests due to mixed content, CORS failures, etc., would not.</p>

      <p>When a <a>network error</a> occurs for a URL that belongs to a <a>known NEL origin</a> the user agent SHOULD log the error and attempt to deliver it to the <a title="report-uri">report URL</a> defined by the <a>NEL policy</a> of the associated <a>NEL origin</a>:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The user agent SHOULD make best effort to deliver the error report as soon as possible to provide the necessary real-time feedback.</li>
        <li>The user agent MAY delay delivery of the report to account for poor or missing connectivity (e.g. temporarily offline due to poor service).</li>
        <li>The user agent MAY abandon delivery of the report if the time of error exceeds 24 hours, or if the <a title="report-uri">report URL</a> is not responding or returns an error.</li>
        <li>The user agent MAY aggregate multiple error reports for the same <a>NEL origin</a> and deliver them in a single report.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To generate a <dfn>network error object</dfn>, the user agent MUST use an algorithm equivalent to the following:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Prepare a JSON object <i>neterror</i> with the following keys and values:

          <dl>
            <dt id="report-uri"><a href="#report-uri"></a>uri</dt>

              <li>A host identified by an IPv6 address is represented as an ordered list of eight 16-bit pieces (a sequence of `x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x`, where the 'x's are one to four hexadecimal digits of the eight 16-bit pieces of the address). [[RFC4291]] </li>

            <p>The user agent MAY extend the above error type list with custom values - e.g. new error types to accommodate new protocols, or more detailed error descriptions of existing ones. When doing so, the user agent SHOULD follow the dot-delimited pattern (`[group].[optional-subgroup].[error-name]`) to facilitate simple and consistent processing of the error reports - e.g. the collector may provide aggregation by category and/or one or multiple subgroups.</p>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <section>
        <h2>Sample Policy Definitions</h2>
        <pre class="example">
&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: example.com

&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt; ...
&lt; NEL: report-uri="https://example.com/report"; max-age=2592000
        </pre>

        <p>The above <a>NEL policy</a> provided in the server response specifies that the user agent should register a new <a>NEL policy</a>, or update an existing one if one already exists, for the `example.com` <a>NEL origin</a>: the user agent should report network errors to `https://example.com/report` and the policy applies for 2592000 seconds (30 days).</p>

        <p>Note that above registration will only succeed if the response is communicated from a `Potentially Trustworthy` origin - see <a href="#policy-delivery-and-processing"></a>.</p>

        <pre class="example">
&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: example.com

&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt; ...
&lt; NEL: report-uri="https://other-origin.com/report"; max-age=2592000
        </pre>

        <p>The above <a>NEL policy</a> provided in the server response is similar to the previous example but tells the user agent to report network errors to `https://other-origin.com/report`. The use of an alternative origin that is not coupled with the origin that is being accessed is **strongly encouraged** to enable real-time reporting and improved report delivery - see <a href="#the-report-uri-directive"></a>.</p>

        <pre class="example">
&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: example.com

&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt; ...
&lt; NEL: report-uri="https://example.com/report" "https://other-origin.com/report"; max-age=2592000; includeSubDomains
        </pre>

        <p>The above <a>NEL policy</a> provided in the server response specifies that the user agent should report network errors to `https://example.com/report`, or `https://other-origin.com/report` if the former is unreachable. Further, the policy is extended to all of the subdomains of the issuing <a>NEL origin</a> - see <a href="#the-includesubdomains-directive"></a>.</p>

        <pre class="example">
&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1
&gt; Host: example.com

&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt; ...
&lt; NEL: max-age=0
        </pre>

        <p>The above <a>NEL policy</a> provided in the server response contains <a>max-age</a> set to zero, which indicates that the user agent must delete the current registered <a>NEL policy</a> associated with the `example.com` <a>NEL origin</a> and all of its subdomains:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a>includeSubDomains</a> is implicit when <a>max-age</a> is zero</li>
          <li><a>report-uri</a> is optional when removing a previously registered policy</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sample Network Error Reports</h2>
        <p>This section contains an example network error report the user agent might send when a network error is encountered for a <a>known NEL origin</a>.</p>

        <pre class="highlight">
{
        "nel-report": [
            {
              "uri": "https://www.example.com/",
              "referrer": "http://example.com/",
              "server-ip": "123.122.121.120",
              "protocol": "h2",
              "status-code": 200,
              "elapsed-time": 823,
              "age": 0,
              "type": "http.protocol.error"
            }
          ]
        }
        </pre>

        <p>The above report indicates that the user agent attempted to navigate from "example.com" to "www.example.com" (<a>known NEL origin</a>), which successfully resolved to the "123.122.121.120" IP address. However, while the user agent received a "200" response from the server via the "h2" protocol, it encountered a protocol error in the exchange and was forced to abandon the navigation. 823 milliseconds elapsed between the start of navigation and when the user agent aborted the navigation. Finally, the user agent sent this report immediately after the network error was encountered - i.e. the report age is 0.</p>

        <pre class="highlight">
{
        "nel-report": [
            {
              "uri": "https://widget.com/thing.js",
              "referrer": "https://www.example.com/",
              "server-ip": "234.233.232.231",
              "protocol": "",
              "status-code": 0,
              "elapsed-time": 143,
              "age": 0,
              "type": "http.dns.name_not_resolved"
            }
          ]
        }
        </pre>

        <p>The above report indicates that the user agent attempted to fetch  "https://widget.com/thing.js", which belongs to a previously registered <a>NEL origin</a>, from "www.example.com" origin. However, the user agent was unable to resolve the DNS name and the request was aborted by the user agent after 143 milliseconds. Because "widget.com" is a known NEL origin, a network error report was logged and sent to the report URL specified by the NEL policy of that host immediately after the network error was encountered - i.e. the report age is 0.</p>

      <h2>Use cases</h2>

      <section>
        <h2>Reporting of Navigation Failures</h2>

        <p>A navigation request initiated by the user (e.g. via a click on a link, direct input via the location bar, script-initiated due to user interaction, etc.) may fail due any number of connectivity reasons: DNS failure, TCP error, TLS protocol violation, and so on. These errors may be caused by network misconfiguration, transient routing issues, server downtime, malware or other attacks against the user, etc.</p>

        <p>In such cases the destination host is often left unaware of the failed navigation since, by definition, it cannot see the request reach its infrastructure and it is unable to investigate the problem. To address this, the host can register an <a>NEL policy</a> with the user agent, which specifies where reports of such failures should be delivered such that they can be investigated.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Reporting of First-party Subresource Fetch Failures</h2>

        <p>A typical application requires dozens of resources, the fetching of which is typically initiated via HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. The application requesting such resources can observe failures of most such fetches (e.g. via `onerror` callbacks), but it does not have access to the detailed network error report of why the failure has occurred - e.g. DNS failure, TCP error, TLS protocol violation, etc.</p>

        <p>To address this, the application can register relevant NEL policies with the user agent for the first-party hosts from which the subresources are being fetched. Then, if such a policy is present and a network error is encountered for a resource associated with a registered <a>NEL origin</a>, the user agent will report the detailed network error report and enable the application developers to investigate the error.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Reporting of Third-party Subresource Fetch Failures</h2>

        <p>In the case where a resource is embedded by a third party, the provider of the resource is often unable to instrument and observe the failure. For example, if `example.com` embeds a `widget.com/thing.js` resource on its site, and the user visiting `example.com` fails to fetch such resource due to a network error, the `widget.com` host is both unaware of the failure and unable to detect it.</p>

        <p>To address this, `widget.com` can register an NEL policy for its host. Then, if such policy is present and a network error is encountered while fetching a resource &mdash; regardless of whether it is being requested from a first-party or third-party origin &mdash; from the registered <a>NEL origin</a>, the user agent will report the network error and enable the provider to investigate the error.</p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p><a>NEL</a> provides network error reports that could expose new information about the user's network configuration. For example, an attacker could abuse NEL reporting to probe users network configuration. Also, similar to HSTS, HPKP, and pinned CSP policies, the stored <a>NEL policy</a> could be used as a "supercookie" by setting a distinct policy with a custom (per-user) reporting URI to act as an identififer in combination with (or instead of) HTTP cookies.</p>

      <p>To mitigate some of the above risks, NEL registration is restricted to <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/powerfulfeatures/#is-origin-trustworthy">trustworthy origins</a>, and delivery of network error reports is similarly restricted to <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/powerfulfeatures/#is-origin-trustworthy">trustworthy origins</a>. This disallows a transient HTTP MITM from trivially abusing NEL as a persistent tracker.</p>

      <p>In addition to above restrictions, the user agents MUST:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Clear the stored NEL policies when the user clears their browsing data (cookies, site data, history, etc).</li>
        <li>Refuse to process Set-Cookie response headers when delivering network error reports.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When deploying NEL the developer SHOULD consider privacy implications of NEL reports delivered to the specified collectors. For example, reports may contain URLs with sensitive data (e.g. "Capability URLs") that may need special precautions (see [[!CAPABILITY-URLS]]), and may require the developer to operate their own NEL collectors to prevent reporting of such URLs to third parties.</p>
